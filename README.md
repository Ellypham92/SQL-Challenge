### [MySQL: Datase Management System for Financial Opportunity Center in Houston](https://github.com/Ellypham92/sql-data-analysis/tree/main/sql%20houston%20foc)

- Overview:
The Financial Opportunity Center is one of Houston's five career and personal financial service centers. FOC focuses on improving financial stability for low-to-moderate-income families and provides services across three departments: career improvement, financial education, and public benefits. Each department maintains its file-based client database, hence limiting the collaboration effort between the staff of each department. We're designing a database for Staff, Department, Funding, Funder, Service, Client Case, and Clients. The new database will enhance the collaboration between the departments and improve programs' performance.
- Mission Statement: 
The Financial Opportunity Center database aims to keep track of client data, support FOC daily operations, facilitate collaboration between the departments, and improve program outcomes.
